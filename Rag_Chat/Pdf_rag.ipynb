However, current knowledge has limited potential to fully understand the \\napplication of such resistance training and the muscle changes that occur to differentiate these two types of \\ntraining. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of concentric contraction (CON) and eccentric \\ncontraction (ECC) during an acute bout of resistance training on the hamstring contractile properties. A group of \\n20 female recreational athletes were divided into two equal groups, CON training and ECC training. The con-\\ntractile properties of the muscles on both sides of the body were assessed using tensiomyography (TMG): biceps \\nfemoris (BF) and semitendinosus (ST). The muscles were assessed twice, before and after 10 maximal repetitions \\nof either concentric or eccentric isotonic contractions. The results indicate a greater change in TMG parameters \\nwith ECC training, with p <0.001 (Td and Tc). An acute bout of resistance training induces changes in the \\nmuscle hamstrings contractile properties in both CON and ECC training. Eccentric training causes greater \\nchanges than concentric training, shortening contraction time (Td, Tc), increase radial displacement velocity \\n(Vrd) and affecting changes in muscle belly displacement (Dm), so may be more effective in training.   \\n1.Introduction \\nThe efficiency of the muscular system is a crucial determinant of \\nsports performance, injury prevention, and physical fitness (Bompa & \\nBuzzichelli, 2021 ). Therefore, many studies have focused on designing \\nresistance training programs that would enhance muscle capabilities. \\nResistance training can be oriented towards different goals, leading to \\nvarious adaptations in the muscle system, depending on the applied \\nstimulus. For example, it can be aimed at building strength, hypertro -\\nphy, or muscular endurance (Fleck & Kraemer, 2014; Unlu et al., 2020 ). \\nSkeletal muscles, which are attached to bones and move them rela-\\ntive to each other, can have two types of contraction during muscle \\nactivation: concentric (CON) or eccentric (ECC). In the case of CON, the \\nmuscle attachments are brought closer together, while in ECC, they \\nmove away from each other (Franchi et al., 2017 ). During a CON \\ncontraction, the muscle shortens and exerts force, which is transmitted \\nthrough the tendon to the joint, enabling movement and causing a change in the joint angle. ECC contractions also occur during everyday \\nmovements, allowing for the dissipation of mechanical energy during \\nthe deceleration of body movements (Konow & Roberts, 2015 ). This \\ntype of contraction occurs, for example, during landing from a jump or \\ndescending stairs, in which the quadriceps muscles generate force by \\nlengthening and decelerating the movement. ECC contractions also \\nenable the conversion of kinetic energy into elastic energy stored in the \\ntendons, partially recovering energy and resulting in less muscle work \\n(Hoppeler, 2014 ). During traditional resistance training, which involves \\nlifting or lowering external weight, people combine CON muscle work \\nduring lifting and ECC work during lowering the weight. \\nEccentric muscle contraction is a fundamental process of human \\nmovement, but surprisingly, it is an area of exercise science that has \\nbeen poorly studied. It is believed that ECC contractions may induce \\ngreater muscle strength and hypertrophy than CON contractions, as they \\ngenerate greater muscular force (Franchi et al., 2017; Maeo et al., 2018; \\nMendez-Villanueva et al., 2016 ). However, some authors argue that \\n*Corresponding author at: 76 Pr´oszkowska St., 45-758 Opole, Poland. \\nE-mail address: p.pakosz@po.edu.pl (P.

Concentric resis-\\ntance training can effectively reduce pain (Vincent & Vincent, 2020 ), \\nwhich can limit an organism ’s mobility (Skorupska, 2018; Skorupska \\net al., 2013 ). ECC training, on the other hand, is characterized by the \\nproduction of higher torque (Hollander et al., 2007 ), while generating \\nlower bioelectrical muscle activity (Borysiuk et al., 2018; Pakosz & \\nKonieczny, 2020; Westing et al., 1991 ). Additionally, ECC training may \\nresult in better muscle adaptation in elite athletes in a shorter period of \\ntime (Mendez-Villanueva et al., 2016 ). There is also evidence to suggest \\nthat properly conducted ECC training can prevent injuries (Hu et al., \\n2023 ). Despite many positive aspects, ECC training can cause pain, \\nswelling, and reduced range of motion due to muscle fiber damage, \\nwhich can result in muscle weakness (Kibler & Armstrong, 1990; Paul-\\nsen et al., 2019 ). Therefore, the impact of ECC and CON exercises on \\nmuscle parameters is still a matter of debate, and the mechanisms \\nregulating these adaptations have not been fully elucidated. \\nThe hamstring muscles are key muscles responsible for athlete ’s \\nmovement in many sports disciplines and are also among the most \\nfrequently injured muscles (Brukner, 2015; Ðorđevi´c et al., 2022; \\nEkstrand et al., 2011 ). Their primary function is knee flexion, but they \\nalso perform eccentric work to absorb force during knee extension \\nmovements, slow down momentum during late swing phase of sprinting, \\nand prepare the foot for ground contact. Therefore, ensuring the \\nstrength of the hamstring muscles, especially in eccentric contractions, \\nis important to maintain the overall functional capacity of the muscle \\ngroup and prevent overuse injuries (Schache et al., 2009; Yu et al., \\n2008 ). \\nHowever, the effect of eccentric and concentric muscle contractions \\non the hamstring, measured directly after an acute bout of resistance \\ntraining, remains unclear. Research in this area is significant because \\noptimal muscle contraction ability is crucial for training quality and \\nperformance outcomes (Bompa & Buzzichelli, 2021 ). To assess the \\nmuscular system ’s ability, a relatively new method for monitoring \\nmuscle contraction function, called tensiomyography (TMG), has been \\ndeveloped. TMG is a non-invasive technique that uses a portable device \\nto measure the properties of individual superficial muscles by recording \\nan isometric muscle contraction induced externally by electro -\\nstimulation (Pakosz et al., 2021 ). TMG can provide information about \\nmuscle parameters during the contraction and muscle belly deformation \\n(Macgregor et al., 2018 ). It can also monitor muscle fiber composition, \\ntension of individual muscles, fatigue of these muscles, muscular \\nimbalance in joints, or between both sides of the body (Pakosz et al., \\n2021 ).Tensiomyography (TMG) is a modern diagnostic tool that allows \\nthe examination of isolated muscles or even muscle actones (Macgregor \\net al., 2018 ), which is also achievable with electromyography (EMG) but \\nrequires effort from the subject being tested. This is important for \\nmonitoring athletes ’ physiological status to assess training effectiveness, \\nbut such monitoring requires initial muscle assessment and continuous \\nmonitoring (Mu˜noz-L ´opez et al., 2022 ). \\nDespite numerous studies conducted, the effects of CON and ECC \\ntraining on changes in the muscle contractile properties are still un-\\nknown. Such an assessment can help coaches utilize the differences in \\nmuscle profile during training, which can lead to the development of the \\nmost appropriate training program to enhance muscle growth and pre-\\nvent injuries. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effects \\nof CON vs ECC training on changes in muscle parameters measured by \\nmeans of TMG. The hypothesis was formulated that different training \\nstimuli, such as CON or ECC training, would induce different adapta -\\ntions in hamstring muscle contractile properties after an acute bout of \\nresistance training. We expected ECC training to produce greater \\nchanges than CON training, according to literature. 2.Methods \\n2.1. Study design \\nThis study contributes to the knowledge of the effects of resistance \\ntraining using concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) contractions, the \\neffects of which are known but still poorly understood. A repeated \\nmeasures design was used to determine the temporal response of the \\nmuscle during CON or ECC training. Tensiomyography (TMG) was used \\nas a tool to measure the mechanical response of the muscle. The par-\\nticipants had no previous femoral injuries and were randomly assigned \\nto two equal groups of 10, either CON or ECC training. On the day of the \\nstudy, the athletes were asked to refrain from physical activity and \\nstimulant-containing products. \\n2.2. Participants \\nThe study group comprised of 20 young female athletes (age =21.3 \\n±0.9, body mass =65.4 ±5.4 kg, body height =168.4 ±9.6) who \\nexercised recreationally 3 times a week. The recreational training lasted \\napproximately an hour and a half, and encompassed various physical \\nactivities aimed at improving overall fitness and health. The training \\nprogram included aerobic elements such as jogging, stationary cycling, \\nand treadmill exercises to enhance cardiovascular endurance. Addi-\\ntionally, strength exercises such as weightlifting and machine-based \\nstrength training were incorporated to build muscle strength. The rec-\\nreational training also aimed to develop motor skills, coordination, and \\nflexibility. The athletes also engaged in stretching, pilates, and gym-\\nnastics exercises to improve muscle flexibility and mobility. All partic -\\nipants were right-footed and provided informed consent to participate in \\nthe tests, approved by the Bioethics Commission of the Chamber of \\nPhysicians in Opole No. 260, following the guidelines specified in the \\nDeclaration of Helsinki on human experimentation. \\n2.3. Procedure \\nThe hamstring TMG test was performed twice per athlete: at rest and \\nafter eccentric or concentric muscle resistance training. The resistance \\ntest and measurement were performed on both lower limbs of the \\nhamstring muscles: biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (ST). During \\nthe first test, the athlete had a TMG measurement taken after 10 min of \\nrest from any activity, followed by a 10-minute warm-up on a stationary \\nbike to prepare the hamstring muscles for the test. The load on the \\nstationary bike was 100 W (10 MET), adhering to a rhythm between 60 \\nand 70 revolutions per minute (rpm). The warm-up was followed by the \\nactual resistance test. The athletes were randomly assigned to either an \\neccentric exercise group (ECC) or a concentric exercise group (CON), so \\nthat there were equal numbers of people in each group. Prior to the \\ntesting procedure, participants were instructed to lie face down on the \\nexamination table, with their feet freely hanging beyond the edge. \\nSubsequently, the appropriate testing procedures were conducted, and \\nmuscle responses were recorded. Introducing this specific research po-\\nsition helped minimize disruptions and ensured appropriate and com-\\nparable results among the participants. Tests consisted of 10 maximal \\nconcentric or eccentric repetitions of hamstring muscle work. Manual \\nresistance was adjusted by an one experienced researcher to match the \\nstrength level of each participant and was gradually increased as \\ntraining progressed, so that the last repetition was performed with dif-\\nficulty and the participant was unable to perform another repetition \\n(Fig. 1). Athletes reached a level of fatigue of 9–10 on the 10-point \\nOMNI-RES scale during the test. The tempo of each trial was 3 s at \\nmaximum load, followed by 1 s of rest, 1 s of return to the starting po-\\nsition, and 1 s of rest. In the concentric test, the lower limb was fully \\nextended, followed by a resistance movement where the subject moved \\ntheir heel close to the buttock until 90 degrees of knee flexion was \\nreached, with the hip joint straight. The eccentric test was performed P.

In \\nboth cases, the examiner applied a load to the subject ’s heel, preventing \\nflexion of the knee joint in the CON test and straightening the knee joint \\nfrom 90 degrees to full extension in the ECC test. Verbal encouragement \\nwas given during all exercise tests to elicit maximum effort from the \\nsubject. \\nThe following parameters of TMG were assessed in the study: muscle \\ndisplacement (Dm), contraction time (Tc), and delay time (Td). To \\nobtain a measure that is relatively independent of Dm (muscle belly \\ndisplacement), the radial displacement velocity (Vrd) is calculated as the \\nratio (mm ⋅s\\x001) between the radial displacement occurring within a \\nspecific time period of Tc(0.8 * Dm)/Tc * 1000. This formula is derived \\nfrom the proposal by Valen ˇciˇc & Knez (1997) , where Vr =Δdr/Δtr, with \\nΔdr representing the difference in muscle belly displacement during the \\nrise time, and Δtr denoting the rise time. To record these parameters, a \\npressure sensor connected to a digital displacement converter was used. \\nThe sensor was mounted perpendicular to the belly of the muscle and \\nhad a controlled initial pressure of 1.5 ×10\\x002 N/mm2. The digital \\ndisplacement converter (GK 40 Panoptik d.o.o., Ljubljana, Slovenia) had \\na spring installed with a value of 0.17 N/mm. The sensor was placed on \\nthe thickest fragment of the muscle belly, which was determined visu-\\nally and by palpation during voluntary contraction. The muscle was \\nstimulated by two self-adhesive electrodes (Axelgaard, Pulse), which \\nwere spaced 2–5 cm apart and delivered a 1 ms pulse from an electro -\\nstimulator (TMG-S1, Furlan and Co. ltd.). The size and position of the \\nelectrodes were adjusted to isolate the contraction of the target muscle \\nand avoid activation of nearby muscles. Electrical stimulation with a \\npulse duration of 1 ms and an initial current amplitude of 30 mA was \\napplied, which was increased by 10 mA steps until reaching 100 mA \\n(maximum output of the stimulator). A 10-second interval was main -\\ntained between each pulse. The digital TMG signal was taken directly \\nfrom the MATLAB Compiler Toolbox at a sampling frequency of 1 kHz. \\nThe TMG signal was recorded and stored on a portable PC computer. The \\nmaximum amplitude of stimulation was determined as the minimum \\ncurrent required to induce the largest muscle displacement (Dm). \\nBased on previous research conducted by Pakosz et al. (2021) , the \\nreliability of measuring Dm, Tc, and Td was assessed in terms of both \\nrelative and absolute measures. The results indicated high reliability for \\nall three measurements: Dm showed a relative reliability of 0.92 with a \\nrange of 0.80 –0.97, a coefficient of variation (cv) of 6.5 %, and a stan-\\ndard error of measurement (SEM) of 7.35 %. Similarly, Tc demonstrated \\na relative reliability of 0.92 within a range of 0.80 –0.96, a cv of 4.4 %, \\nand an SEM of 4.37 %. Lastly, Td exhibited a relative reliability of 0.93 \\nwith a range of 0.84 –0.97, a cv of 3.4 %, and an SEM of 2.89 %. 2.4. Statistical analyses \\nThe authors employed a repeated measures ANOVA to assess the \\nsignificance of differences among the factors: Muscle (Biceps Femoris - \\nBF, Semitendinosus - ST), Contraction (eccentric - ECC, concentric - \\nCON), Side (Left, Right), and Time (Before, After). Significance was \\ndetermined at p ≤0.05. Additionally, eta squared (ηp2) was utilized as a \\nmeasure of effect size in the ANOVA, with ηp2 values of ≥0.01 indi-\\ncating a small effect, ≥0.06 indicating a medium effect, and ≥0.14 \\nindicating a large effect. The sample size of 20 participants was sensitive \\nenough to detect an effect size of f =0.19, a power of 80 %, and a sig-\\nnificance level of 5 %, as indicated by the GPower tool. The data was \\nanalysed using Jamovi 2.2.3 software. \\n3.Results \\nThe results of parameter Td showed that the Contraction factor had a \\nsignificant and large effect on muscle performance (p <0.001, ηp2 =\\n0.27), and the Muscle factor displayed a statistically significant but \\nmedium effect (p =0.037, ηp2 =0.06) (Table 1). While the factor \\nMuscle and Contraction did not have significant effects, and the effect \\nwas small (p =0.726, ηp2 =0.04). Regarding the differences between \\nmuscle groups, the results showed that there were no significant dif-\\nferences between muscle groups (p >0.05). Finally, the study examined \\nthe effects of different exercise interventions on muscle performance. \\nThe results showed that there were significant differences between ECC \\nBefore and ECC After (p <0.001), as well as between CON Before and \\nCON After (p =0.025). \\nThe results of parameter Tc showed that the factor of Contraction \\nhad a significant and large effect on muscle performance (p <0.001, \\nηp2 =0.17), while the factor of Muscle and the interaction between \\nMuscle and Contraction did not have significant effects, and the effect \\nwas small (Muscle: p =0.051, ηp2 =0.05; Muscle ×Contraction: p =\\n0.884, ηp2 =0.03) (Table 2). Regarding the differences between muscle \\ngroups, the results showed that there were no significant differences \\nbetween muscles. Finally, the study examined the effects of different \\nexercise interventions on muscle performance. The results showed that \\nthere were significant differences between ECC Before and ECC After (p \\n<0.001), but there were no significant differences between CON Before \\nand CON After (p =0.708). \\nThe results of parameter Dm showed that the factor of Muscle had a \\nsignificant and medium effect on muscle performance (F =4.554, p =\\n0.004, ηp2 =0.09), while the factor of Contraction and the interaction \\nbetween Muscle and Contraction did not have significant effects, and the \\neffect was small (Contraction: F =2.565, p =0.057, ηp2 =0.05; Muscle \\n×Contraction: F =0.221, p =0.991, ηp2 =0.01) (Table 3).

However, the type of contraction during training \\nsignificantly differentiated the results (Table 4). \\nEccentric training produced greater and significant changes in the \\nneural and muscular profile of the hamstring muscles compared to \\nconcentric training. The Td, Tc were significantly shorter, the Dm was \\nlower after the ECC training, and Vrd increased in both trainings. The \\nresults suggest that eccentric training may be more effective in \\nimproving the neural alsond muscular adaptations of the hamstring \\nmuscle group compared to concentric training. Specifically, ECC \\ntraining resulted in a reduction of the parameters: Td by 4.1 ms, Tc by \\n10.3 ms, Dm by 0.89 mm and increased Vrd by 44 mm⋅s\\x001, whereas CON \\ntraining only reduced Td by 1.9 ms and Tc by 2.2 ms, and increased Dm \\nby 0.24 mm and Vrd by 20 mm⋅s\\x001. \\nThe table shows the results of a study on the effects of an acute bout \\nof resistance training on the contractile properties of the hamstring \\nmuscles (Table 5). The data is divided by muscle (left and right biceps \\nfemoris and semitendinosus) and contraction type (CON and ECC) and \\ncompared before and after the training. The results show that resistance \\ntraining causes changes in the muscle contractile properties of the \\nhamstring muscles, regardless of the contraction type, as evidenced by \\nthe decreased time delay (Td), contraction time (Tc) and increased \\nradial displacement velocity (Vrd). In terms of contraction type, \\neccentric training resulted in greater and significant changes in the muscle contractile properties of the hamstring muscles than concentric \\ntraining. \\n4.Discussion \\nThe present study aimed to investigate the effects of an acute bout of \\nresistance training on the contractile properties of the hamstring mus-\\ncles, specifically focusing on the impact of contraction type (CON vs. \\nECC) on muscle performance. The results revealed several significant \\nfindings, providing valuable insights into the muscular adaptations of \\nthe hamstring muscles following different exercise interventions. The \\nstudy evaluated the muscle contractile properties of the hamstring, \\nthrough changes in time contraction and displacement of the muscle \\nbelly measured by TMG. A muscle with a short contraction time and \\ndelay (Tc, Td) indicates high explosiveness, while a muscle with a long \\ncontraction time exhibits slowness (Macgregor et al., 2018 ). A large \\nmuscle displacement (Dm) indicates a looser muscle belly, whereas \\nwhen the muscle has a small displacement, it indicates muscle stiffness \\n(García-Manso et al., 2011 ). \\nIn the present study Td parameter, representing time delay, \\ndecreased in both training types, with ECC showing a twofold greater \\ndecrease, indicating similar body reactions to thigh flexion training as \\nobserved in gymnasts (Vernetta-Santana et al., 2018 ). The Contraction \\nfactor significantly impacted muscle performance, while the Muscle \\nfactor had a medium effect. The Muscle and Contraction interaction did \\nnot yield significant effects, suggesting minimal combined influence. No \\nsignificant variations in muscle performance were observed across \\ndifferent muscle groups, indicating consistent responses to exercise in-\\nterventions.

No significant differences in muscle performance \\nwere found between muscle groups. ECC training resulted in a greater \\nincrease in the velocity of radial muscle displacement (Vrd) compared to \\nCON training, increase in this parameter was also seen after high- \\nvolume resistance exercise the biceps brachii muscles (García-Manso \\net al., 2012 ). This is of significant importance for muscle functionality \\nand movement performance. A higher level of Vrd may indicate faster \\nand more dynamic muscle contractions, which could suggest good \\nmuscle force generation and a rapid response to stimuli. The Dm \\nparameter decreased after ECC training and increased after CON \\ntraining, potentially indicating increased muscle stiffness and reduced \\nparameter values like in plyometric training (Zubac & ˇSimuni ˇc, 2017 ). \\nThe Muscle factor significantly impacted muscle performance, while the \\nContraction factor and Muscle ×Contraction interaction had limited \\neffects. No significant differences in muscle performance were observed \\nbetween muscle groups. ECC training resulted in faster muscle \\ncontraction and a decrease in Dm, suggesting a greater impact on muscle \\nexplosiveness compared to CON training. These findings can be linked to \\nstudies associating shorter contraction time (Tc) with higher force \\ndevelopment rates and the characteristics of strength-trained athletes \\n(ˇSimuni et al., 2018; Wilson et al., 2019 ). \\nThe results obtained during the study hold significant importance as \\nthey shed light on the contrasting nature of these two types of con-\\ntractions and their impact on athletes. Specifically, these contractions \\ndiffer fundamentally in terms of their force generation mechanisms, \\nmaximal force production, and energy cost, as indicated by Brazier et al. \\n(2019) . It is widely acknowledged that eccentric movements generate \\ngreater force compared to isometric and concentric contractions, while \\nalso incurring lower metabolic costs. This enables athletes to train with \\nheavier loads, as supported by Brazier et al. (2019) and Hyldahl and \\nHubal (2014) . Moreover, concentric and eccentric contractions exhibit \\nnotable distinctions in terms of neural drive, as discussed by Duchateau \\nand Enoka (2016) . Additionally, the amplitude of electromyography \\n(EMG) signals tends to be higher during shortening contractions \\ncompared to lengthening contractions, as highlighted by Bollinger et al. \\n(2022) . Furthermore, due to the increased muscular capacity during \\nlengthening contractions, fewer motor units are recruited, and the \\ndischarge rate is lower in comparison to shortening contractions \\n(Duchateau & Enoka, 2016 ). The prevailing assumption is that eccentric \\nresistance training yields greater effects than concentric resistance \\ntraining due to the higher mechanical load associated with active \\nlengthening. However, it is worth noting that various studies have re-\\nported conflicting findings, with some favoring eccentric training, some \\nfavoring concentric training, and others indicating similar effects from \\nboth training modes (Hyldahl & Hubal, 2014 ). \\nIn the present study, both maximum load training sessions were \\nperformed, and it was found that eccentric training led to greater re-\\nsponses in muscle contractile properties. This finding aligns with pre-\\nvious research by Franchi et al. (2014) , which also observed greater \\nforces associated with eccentric (ECC) training compared to concentric \\n(CON) training. Additionally, Maeo et al. (2018) demonstrated that \\neccentric training induces greater muscular changes than concentric \\ntraining, further supporting our results. It is widely acknowledged that \\napplying a greater external load during the eccentric phase of an exer-\\ncise can create a potential stimulus of higher intensity. This higher in-\\ntensity stimulus has been linked to various muscular, morphological, \\nand molecular changes (Franchi & Maffiuletti, 2019 ). Notably, high- \\nintensity eccentric exercises have been shown to increase strength, \\nneuronal activation, and hypertrophy (Douglas et al., 2017a, 2017b ). \\nConsequently, there is significant interest in eccentric training, partic -\\nularly among athletes and coaching staff involved in strength and power \\nsports (Dolezal et al., 2016 ). Additionally, both training CON and ECC \\nresult in similar muscle hypertrophy, which is achieved through various \\nstructural adaptations that may be regulated by different myogenic and \\nmolecular responses observed between lengthening and shortening contractions (Franchi et al., 2017 ). However, this study was able to \\ndemonstrate differences in the change of the muscle contractile prop-\\nerties of these different types of training, with eccentric training being \\nindicated as the one in which muscular changes are more pronounced \\nthan in concentric training. Therefore, when programming training \\nprograms, it is worth paying attention to building efficient muscles \\nthrough ECC contractions, which seem to bring many benefits. \\nThe overall results of the study demonstrate that both eccentric and \\nconcentric training led to changes in the neural and muscular profiles of \\nthe hamstring muscles, as evidenced by the observed shorter Td and Tc, \\nvaried results in Dm, and increased Vrd following the training in-\\nterventions. However, the type of contraction employed during the \\ntraining significantly differentiated the results. Eccentric training \\ninduced greater and significant changes in the neural and muscular \\nprofiles of the hamstring muscles compared to concentric training. \\nSpecifically, eccentric training led to a reduction in Td and Tc, a \\ndecrease in Dm, and an increase in Vrd. In contrast, concentric training \\nexhibited a smaller impact on muscle performance, with only slight \\nreductions in Td and Tc, an increase in Dm, and a lesser increase in Vrd. \\nThese findings suggest that eccentric training may be more effective \\nthan concentric training in improving the muscular adaptations of the \\nhamstring muscle group. \\nDespite the many practical advantages, this study has some limita -\\ntions. One of them is the potential lack of generalizability of our results \\ndue to differences between sexes in certain muscles regarding contrac -\\ntile properties. Further research will be necessary in the future to better \\nunderstand and incorporate these differences, allowing for a more \\ncomprehensive analysis of the impact of TMG on different gender \\ngroups. The limitations of the study could be also the selection of only \\none muscle group. However, this muscle group was chosen because it is \\nresponsible for most injuries in professional sports, causing high costs \\nfor entire organizations and the healthcare system. These were pre-\\nliminary studies conducted only on women, and in the future, it would \\nbe worthwhile to expand the study group and conduct studies on groups \\nof professional athletes. \\nCRediT authorship contribution statement \\nPawe ł Pakosz: Funding acquisition, Project administration, Super -\\nvision, Visualization, Writing – review & editing, Writing – original \\ndraft, Data curation, Investigation, Formal analysis, Validation, \\nConceptualization, Methodology.
